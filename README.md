CSCI344-Project-1
=================

Web App made with Foundation and Bootstrap

Foundation influence: 

http://webcoursesagency.com/  I like the layout of the page and will try to model mine after it a little bit.

http://www.zurb.com/jobs/250-mashape-ux-ui-designer The way the page is designed is pretty much how my extra.html will 
hopefully turn out.

=====================================

Bootstrap Influence:

http://www.concord-software.com/ using as a basis for my front page model

http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB004K715 using layout template for my content page


ISSUES*

Could not get the carousel feature to work properly in Bootstrap, so I trashed it entirely and chose to stick with a single 
image. 

Final thoughts: Bootstrap = FRUSTRATING
                Foundation = user friendly and intuitive
