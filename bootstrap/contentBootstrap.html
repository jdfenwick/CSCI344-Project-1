        <h1>What's this all about?</h1>
        <p>Our mission here at Music Network is simple: Connect the fans to the musicians directly. We offer a unique way for you do that, regardless of which you are.
           Create your own blog, write about your experiences. We want you to be honest about it!</p>
        <p>We've all wanted to meet our favorite musicians and just be able to chat with them from time to time, or maybe just have more insight into their mind.
           Some of us just want to document our musical experiences and knowledge without people asking one billion questions 
         (musicans, you know what I'm talking about)!</p>  
        <p>There are also those of us who like going to festivals, well for those of you who fit into this category, we are working hard on implimenting a feature that
           lists all of the upcoming festivals and up-to-date line-ups of who is playing. We are even working on making it so even the small venues will get listed as well! 
           Support your locals everyone, without them, where are all the great up and coming bands going to play?</p>
        <p>And we have all been to shows that have lacked, or where bands cancel. For this reason, we encourage Fans to not only talk about these things,
           but rate the shows that they go to! Was the band too loud? Did the entire band seem under the influence? Share your opinion!</p>
        <p>Or maybe you are a musician and you are tired of people not showing up to your shows. Advertise! Post links to your pages, your music,
           and give people a reason to come out!</p>
        <p>Most of all, we wish for the fans and musicians to connect and be friendly with each other. Share with one another. Learn from each other. 
           And most of all, enjoy the music!</p>
